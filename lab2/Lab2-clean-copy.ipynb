Keras APIs provide straightforward construction and training of neural networks, which hide away some tedious details of the network. \n",

    "Some may argue that low-level APIs provide more precise control over some aspects of the network. While users can still find a way to tune the details by looking deeper into the APIs, the framework encourages them to focus on the big picture and develop better and more robust network models rather than fixating on trivialities.

    "from tensorflow import keras\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",

    "\n",
    "### Build, Train, and Evaluate\n",
    "Generally, there are three stages in the process of developing a neural network: build, train, and evaluate. In Keras, there are corresponding functions for each stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Build** First, you define the model architecture. In this lab, you can use a simple `keras.Sequential` function to define a model, as shown in this [example][sequential]. There are other ways to define a model, but we will not discuss those in this lab. After you have defined your model, you need to tell Keras what you want to do with it by compiling it. In the `model.compile` function, you specify the optimizer, loss function, metrics, and other configurations to prepare for training.\n",
    "2. **Train** You use `model.fit` function to train your model. In this function, you can specify the training parameters, including batch size, epochs, etc. You should specify your validation split in this function too. Please refer to the document and see how to do that.\n",
    "3. **Evaluate** After you have trained your model, you need to test the final accuracy using the testing data. The `model.evaluate` function gives you the percentage of the correct results. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the document for the above functions [here][fit_api].\n",
    "You may also find that in FashionNet, you use 2-D convolution in the first couple of layers. You may find [this document][layer_api] helpful since the `layers.Conv2D` and `layers.MaxPool2D` functions are not covered in the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training of this CNN should not take a very long time on a laptop/desktop CPU. The final testing accuracy should be higher than 85%, and the training accuracy should be higher than 90%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plot the Training Progress\n",
    "The `model.fit` function outputs a history of the training metrics (accuracy and loss), including validation metrics. This infomation can be very helpful for diagnosing the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use `matplotlib` to graph the model accuracy and loss on the training and validation dataset, and include them in your report.** The graph should look something like the following, but yours can be different if you have different configurations of the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "![train_img](figures/train.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving Your Trained Model\n",
    "Finally, you will need to save your trained models to model files. Saving a trained model allows you to deploy it to other devices or restore previous training progress at a later time. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this lab, we ask you to save it using **the TensorFlow SavedModel format**, which will contain the information of the model as well as the weights.\n",

The [Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN)][MTCNN] is one of the pioneering works in this area. It is purposedly built for detecting human faces and also identifying the keypoints (eyes, nose, and mouth). It is one of the most popular and successful networks in this area.\n",

However, you should notice that, while having a convenient python package, MTCNN is not dedicated to real-time detection on mobile devices. Therefore the inference latency is a few seconds on the Raspberry Pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this step, you will first instantiate the MTCNN from the mtcnn package. Then, write a function that does the following operations. The function prototype is given to you:\n",
    "1. Perform face detection with MTCNN and extract the bounding box of the first image.\n",
    "2. Add a 20% margin to each dimension of the bounding box, such that the bounding box is 120% of the original size in each dimension. That is, the bounding box is expanded by 10% in each direction(up, down, left, right).\n",
    "3. Perform image cropping according to the coordinate of the extended bounding box.\n",
    "4. Return the cropped image and the coordinates (x, y, w, h) of the bounding box.\n",

    "- The basic usage of MTCNN can be found in the MTCNN python package description [here][MTCNN_package]. As you may find out, the interface is very compact and intuitive. For this lab, you only need the 'box' from the output, which specifies the coordinates of a corner and the dimensions of the bounding box.\n",
